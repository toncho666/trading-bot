def trading_strategy(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    This trading strategy generates buy and sell signals based on the relationship between
    the open and close prices of consecutive candles. The strategy is as follows:
    
    - Sell Signal: 
      If the close of the previous candle is greater than the open of the previous candle by 0.5%,
      and the close of the current candle is less than the open of the current candle.
      
    - Buy Signal:
      If the open of the previous candle is greater than the close of the previous candle by 0.5%,
      and the close of the current candle is greater than the open of the current candle.
    
    The function adds a new column 'signal' to the DataFrame, where:
    - 'sell' indicates a sell signal
    - 'buy' indicates a buy signal
    - None indicates no signal
    
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing at least 'open' and 'close' columns.
    
    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with an additional 'signal' column.

        prev_close = df.loc[i-1, 'close']
        prev_open = df.loc[i-1, 'open']

        curr_open = df.loc[i, 'open']

        # Buy condition

```

This function implements the described trading strategy by iterating over the DataFrame and checking the conditions for each row, starting from the second row (index 1) since it needs to compare with the previous row. The signals are stored in a new column named 'signal'.
