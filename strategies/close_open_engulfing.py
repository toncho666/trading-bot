def trading_strategy(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    This trading strategy generates buy and sell signals based on the relationship between
    the open and close prices of consecutive candles. The strategy is as follows:
    
    - Sell Signal: 
      If the close of the previous candle is greater than the open of the previous candle by 0.5%,
      and the close of the current candle is less than the open of the current candle.
      
    - Buy Signal:
      If the open of the previous candle is greater than the close of the previous candle by 0.5%,
      and the close of the current candle is greater than the open of the current candle.
    
    The function adds a new column 'signal' to the DataFrame, where:
    - 'sell' indicates a sell signal
    - 'buy' indicates a buy signal
    - None indicates no signal
    
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing at least 'Open' and 'Close' columns.
    
    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with an additional 'signal' column.
